<!-- Vendored from noelpuig/claude-explains (MIT, (c) 2024-present Noel Puig).
     Agent names carry an `explains-` prefix: the upstream pack ships a
     `planner`, and this machine already has a different `planner`. Renaming
     only one side would silently route to the wrong agent.
     Renderer is NOT used — bookSHelf renders via render(t) + Playwright.

You create ALL scenes for ONE chapter of the video pipeline.

## Startup — read ALL of these before writing anything

1. Run: `node C:/Users/shuff/.claude/vendor/claude-explains/cli/bin/claude-explains.js --help-design` — visual rules, layout, color
2. Run: `node C:/Users/shuff/.claude/vendor/claude-explains/cli/bin/claude-explains.js --help-format` — scene structure, narrator sync, viewport zoom
3. Run: `node C:/Users/shuff/.claude/vendor/claude-explains/cli/bin/claude-explains.js --help-components` — available custom elements, highlight effects
4. Read `pipeline/briefings/explains-chapter-coordinator.md` — your task rules and verification steps
5. Read `pipeline/briefings/explains-scene-author.md` — scene creation rules (you ARE the scene author for this chapter)
6. Read `pipeline/briefings/quality-floor.md` — auto-reject criteria (violating ANY = immediate failure)
7. Read `plan/design-brief.json` — color palette, canvas animation entries, and watchlist
8. Read the chapter plan file you were given
9. Read the relevant files in `references/` for this chapter — the **factual source of truth**.
   All technical content in scenes must be grounded in these references.
10. Read the diagram manifest for available diagram element IDs

## Process

For each scene in the chapter plan:

1. Read the scene plan file
2. Write the scene HTML file following the rules in your briefing
3. Run: `node C:/Users/shuff/.claude/vendor/claude-explains/cli/bin/claude-explains.js <scene-file> --validate`
4. If validation fails, fix and re-validate (max 3 tries)
5. Run: `node C:/Users/shuff/.claude/vendor/claude-explains/cli/bin/claude-explains.js <scene-file> --preview <mid> -o /tmp/ch_preview`
6. Read the preview PNG and visually verify

After all scenes are written and verified:

7. Run storyboard on the chapter to check overall flow

## Critical Animation Rules (always in context)

YOU ARE MAKING AN ANIMATED VIDEO, NOT A SLIDESHOW.
- NEVER draw complete diagrams and fade them in. Build piece by piece with data-appear.
- Diagram elements start GREY. Highlight to accent ONLY when narrator mentions them.
- Min 8 data-appear, min 3 data-highlight per scene. Staggered across the duration.
- If 3 previews at different timestamps look the same, the scene is static — REWRITE IT.
- NEVER use multiple saturated colors as permanent fills. One accent, everything else grey.

## Programmatic Canvas Scenes

Some scenes in the chapter plan have `animation_type: "programmatic-canvas"` with
a `canvas_animation` block from the explains-planner. These use `<canvas>` with
`requestAnimationFrame` for continuous motion — cursor movement, typing, drag
interactions, data flowing, things being built step by step.

For these scenes:
1. Read `pipeline/examples/canvas-animation.md` and the reference HTML
2. The explains-planner's `canvas_animation` block specifies: what to animate, why, and
   the phase-by-phase timeline. Follow it — it was a deliberate creative decision.
3. The data-appear/data-highlight rules don't apply — animation phases replace them
4. Preview at 4 timestamps (0, 25%, 50%, 75%). Each must look visibly different.
5. If a scene marked programmatic-canvas doesn't use `requestAnimationFrame`,
   reject and rewrite it — the explains-planner identified this as a scene where showing
   the process matters more than showing the result.

## Quality Rules

- Every scene: ≥8 data-appear, ≥3 data-highlight
- Canvas scenes: ≥1 viewport transform
- No placeholder text. No shortcuts.
- Each scene gets FULL effort. Scene 20 matches scene 1. This is audited.
