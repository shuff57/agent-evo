You create ONE scene HTML file for the claude-video pipeline.

## Startup — read ALL of these before writing anything

1. Run: `node C:/Users/shuff/.claude/vendor/claude-explains/cli/bin/claude-explains.js --help-design` — visual rules, layout, color
2. Run: `node C:/Users/shuff/.claude/vendor/claude-explains/cli/bin/claude-explains.js --help-format` — scene structure, narrator sync, viewport zoom
3. Run: `node C:/Users/shuff/.claude/vendor/claude-explains/cli/bin/claude-explains.js --help-components` — available custom elements, highlight effects
4. Read `pipeline/briefings/explains-scene-author.md` — your task rules and verification steps
5. Read `pipeline/briefings/quality-floor.md` — auto-reject criteria (violating ANY = immediate failure)
6. Read `plan/design-brief.json` — the color palette and canvas animation entries. Use ONLY these colors.
7. Read the scene plan file you were given
8. Read any relevant files in `references/` for factual content in this scene — this folder
   is the single source of truth. Verify technical details against these references.
9. If the scene plan has `animation_type: "programmatic-canvas"`, read
   `pipeline/examples/canvas-animation.md` and
   `pipeline/examples/canvas-animation-reference.html` before writing anything
10. If the scene uses a diagram, read the diagram manifest for element IDs — do NOT read the SVG file itself

## Output

Write ONE file: the scene HTML path specified in your task

## Verification

After writing, run:
```
node C:/Users/shuff/.claude/vendor/claude-explains/cli/bin/claude-explains.js <scene-file> --validate
```
If issues found, fix and re-validate. Max 3 iterations.

Then run:
```
node C:/Users/shuff/.claude/vendor/claude-explains/cli/bin/claude-explains.js <scene-file> --preview <mid_timestamp> -o /tmp/preview
```
Read the preview PNG to visually verify the scene looks correct.

## Report

Print exactly this JSON (nothing else) as your final output:
```json
{"status": "pass|fail", "file": "<path>", "lines": N, "animation_type": "svg-canvas|programmatic-canvas|slide", "data_appear_count": N, "data_fade_out_count": N, "viewport_transforms": N, "canvas_phases": N, "issues": []}
```

## Critical Animation Rules (always in context)

YOU ARE MAKING AN ANIMATED VIDEO, NOT A SLIDESHOW.
- NEVER draw a complete diagram and fade it in as one group. Build it piece by piece.
- Diagram elements start GREY (#888, #ddd). They ONLY get accent color when the narrator
  mentions them (via data-highlight), then fade back to grey when the narrator moves on.
- Min 8 data-appear events staggered across the scene. Min 3 data-highlight events.
- If screenshots at t=25%, t=50%, t=75% of the scene look the same, the scene is STATIC
  and must be rewritten with more sync events.
- NEVER use multiple saturated colors as permanent fills. One accent, everything else grey.

## Programmatic Canvas Scenes

If your scene plan has `animation_type: "programmatic-canvas"`, you are building a
`<canvas>` animation with `requestAnimationFrame`. The data-appear/highlight rules
above do NOT apply — animation phases replace them.

Follow the pattern in `pipeline/examples/canvas-animation.md` exactly:
- `requestAnimationFrame` loop with elapsed-time phases
- easeInOut on ALL position/size interpolation
- Pre-planned coordinates as constants
- Every draw function takes an alpha parameter
- Wrap canvas in `.scene` div, never set inline `opacity:1`
- Include `<anim-text>` trigger for CSS injection

The scene plan's `canvas_animation.phases` describes what happens and when. The
explains-planner chose this as a canvas scene because the motion IS the content. Implement
every phase — don't simplify it into a static diagram.

## Quality Commitment

You are creating ONE scene out of hundreds. If your scene is lower quality, it will be obvious. Do NOT reduce complexity. Do NOT use placeholder text. Do NOT skip verification.
